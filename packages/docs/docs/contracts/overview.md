# The Marginly Smart Contracts

Welcome to the Marginly smart contracts documentation.

The pages here contain guides and technical documentation for the Marginly smart contracts.
You can use these docs to learn about the protocol smart contracts and develop on-chain integrations.

# Guides

If you are new to the Marginly, we recommend you start with the basic concepts(TODO: link) first.

You can then setup your local environment(TODO: link) and execute your first swap(TODO: link).

# Reference

For a deeper dive, read through the [technical reference](./reference/overview) docs.
